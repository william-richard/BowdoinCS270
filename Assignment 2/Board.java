 * 
 *  The board interface represents the theater in which moves are made 
 *  and evaluated.  You can make and unmake moves on a board, you can
 *  ask for the list of moves that are currently allowed, and you can 
 *  ask if the game has been won.
 *  You can ask a board for its statistics object to evaluate the score
 *  and how each player is doing.
 * 
 *  A board must be cloneable because a clone of a board is given to players
 *  when we ask them to move, rather than the board itself.  
 *  
 *  Threading issue.  Note that the board's .move(..) method will be called 
 *  in a seperate thread.  It is possible that the GameMaster() may call
 *  .startGame() .stopGame() or .restartGame() from another thread while the
 *  the game loop is in .move() or vice versa.  
 *  If you synchronize all these methods you should be fine.
