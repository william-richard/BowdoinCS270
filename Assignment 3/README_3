COMPILING

To compile the program, call
   javac MaxSatSolver


RUNNING

To run the program, call
   java MaxSatSolver <location of SAT problem> <number of iterations to run it on> <number of candidate solutions to make per iteration> <positive learning rate> <negative learning rate> <mutation probability> <mutation amout>

For example,
    java MaxSatSolver ~/maxsat-problems/maxsat-random/highgirth/4SAT/HG-4SAT-V100-C900-5.cnf 2000 100 .1 .075 .02 .05
Will solve the problem in HG-4SAT-V100-C900-5.cnf using 2000 iteration, creating 100 candidate solutions per iteration, a positive learning rate of .1, a negative learning rate of .075, a mutation probability of .02 and a mutation amount of .05.

To turn off negative learning, open MaxSatSolver.java and set the boolean "useNegativeLearning" on line 25 to false.  To turn it back on, set it to true.

To output data to stat files, change the boolean WRITE_STATS_TO_FILES on line 10 to true, and change the OUTPUT_FILE_LOCATION on line 11 to where you want the stat files to be outputted to.  Keep in mind, if WRITE_STATS_TO_FILES is set to true, the program will ignore any command line parameters, and instead run based on the method "runAllVariableCombinations" starting on line 302.
